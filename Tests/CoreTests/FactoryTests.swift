/**
 üì¶ 1. Initialization

  Factory can be initialized with a .sync block.
  Factory can be initialized with an .async block.
 ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Synchronous Resolution

  .sync block returns the correct result when called synchronously.
  .sync block returns the correct result when called asynchronously.
  .sync block correctly propagates thrown errors.
 ‚è≥ 3. Asynchronous Resolution

  .async block returns the correct result when called asynchronously.
  Calling .async block synchronously throws AstrojectError.invalidFactory.
  .async block correctly propagates thrown errors.
 üü∞ 4. Equality

  Two different factories with the same closure are not equal (due to different UUIDs).
  A factory is equal to itself.
 üß™ 5. Miscellaneous

  Factory handles complex arguments (e.g. custom structs, tuples).
  Factory supports Void arguments (()).
  Calling an async block from within a Task context works as expected.
  callAsFunction overloads correctly dispatch to the underlying block.
